## Introduction

This paper is a conclusion due to a [direction poll taken by LEWG in Tokyo 2024](https://github.com/orgs/cplusplus/projects/23/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=53521817). Discussions related to [P3162R0](https://wg21.link/P3162R0) and [P3122R1](https://wg21.link/P3122R1) led to an alternative and simpler policy. More context, introduction, and rationale can be found in the mentioned papers.

### LEWG Tokyo 2024 direction poll

## Wording for SD-9


Append to [List of Standard Library Policies](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2267r1.html#list-of-standard-library-policies) section of SD-9 ([P2267R1: Library Evolution Policies](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2267r1.html)):

> X. (P3201R1) **[[nodiscard]]** policy: Library wording should not use [[nodiscard]].
>> Rationale: Warnings are non-normative so [[nodiscard]] placement has a spurious impact. Furthermore, implementors are better qualified to identify when and where to emit warnings for their implementations.
